## Junos Automation Stack and DevOps Concepts

### Continuous Delivery
+ Continuous Delivery is required for Continuous Deployment.
+ Continuous Delivery means that software is deployed on demand when there is a new software build.
+ Feedback : Continuous Delivery ensures code is ready to deploy at any time (with actual deploy not necessarily happening in a fully automated way), and Continuous Deployment includes the stage of automated deployment.

### The waterfall model of software development
+ One phase of development must be completed before the next phase can start.
+ This method lacks flexibility.
+ Feedback : With the waterfall model, the next phase only starts after finishing the previous one. When requirements change and a need to develop new functionality appears, the waterfall model shows its weakness. It is not flexible enough and requires a lot of time before new functionality can be brought to production.
