### Software Suites
+ OpenStack
+ vSphere

+ **Feedback : OpenStack, vSphere, and Kubernetes are used in different roles in cloud architectures.**

### Secure VPN Technology
+ IPsec VPN
+ **Feedback : Access to private cloud environments is through private leased connections, or over the Internet through secure VPN access. IPsec VPN encrypts and hashes traffic as it traverses the putlic Internet.**

### Layer 2 Loop Prevention Protocols
+ MC-LAG
+ LACP
+ **Feedback : MC-LAG and LACP provide link and device redundancy without the need for Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**

### VXLAN Tunnel
+ EVPN
+ **Feedback : Some of the most common tunneling technologies are MPLS over GRE and VXLAN, where EVPN is used to establish and maintain VXLAN tunnels.**

### PaaS
+ PaaS
+ **Feedback : Platform as a Service, or PaaS, goes one step beyond IaaS by providing a requested operating system on which applications can be installed.**

### Underlay Network
+ BGP
+ **Feedback : The scalability of Layer 3 protocols, especially with regards to BGP, is much higher than Layer 2 technologies, and can scale from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of host devices.**

### Data Center Underlay Network
+ spine network device redundancy
+ fast failover
+ **Feedback : Redundancy and high availability are two key properties of a robust underlay network.**

### Private Cloud
+ Resources are dedicated to your organization.
+ Resources are accessed through a private connection.
+ **Feedback : Resources are not shared among multiple tenants, and access to the resources are through a private connection, as opposed to a general public connection.**
