## Encrypted traffic, and particularly TLS, is common and TLS guarantees both the validation of the server to the client and the privacy of the exchange over the network. But it is difficult to evaluate the payload of packets. The solution is to put a supplementary dedicated box near to the application server, usually named the Hardware Security Module (HSM). What is the purpose of HSM? What is the purpose of HSM?
+ The HSM is designed to establish the TLS session beforehand the application server delivers any information
+ HSM transfers the burden of establishing the TLS session external to the application server
+ TLS secured traffic is encrypted and decrypted at the HSM, and streams in clear to the server, and triggers IDPSes and WAFs to evaluate the traffic
+ All the options A, B & C include the working functionality of HSM

## The source code of the malware is often not available and, therefore, the first step of static analysis is to disassemble malware binary into assembly code and the most commonly used code obfuscation technique is packing. __________is part of the malware program

## The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names, significant bits of text, to IP addresses needed for network communications.
